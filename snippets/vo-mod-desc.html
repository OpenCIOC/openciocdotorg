This software module is designed for storing and searching Volunteer Opportunities, Volunteer Referrals, and Volunteer Centre membership. Potential Volunteers may create custom search profiles and be notified of new Opportunities matching their criteria. This module operates co-operatively with the Community Resources module, which is used to store contact information and details about the Organizations and Programs offering opportunities.
